Other than the images, this entire game is coded by myself. I spent much of my winter break coding this game and am pretty proud of what I was able to accomplish in an approximately one month window. 

I made this game as my final project for my grade 11 computer science class back in 2014-2015. This was completed in within a one month window, in class and at home. I spent much of my winter break working on this game. This is my first game I coded in c# and being as such, there is some repetitive and inefficient coding. I have learnt a lot since then, and my new knowledge can be seen in my Grade 12 Final Project.

THE GAME.

This is a single-player game for the PC. The player has to survive and two levels of oncoming attacks and defeat all the bad guys. Level 1 is a wave of 20 bad guys who damage the player when they touch the player. They are defeated with fireballs and can be stunned with both your earth attack and the water attack. Level 2 includes more difficult enemies that throws projectiles at the player and run away if the player gets too close to them. These enemies are not affected by the earth or wave attack.
